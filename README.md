# experimental
I'm essentially demo'ing GitHub ere moving my repositories here. 

#documentation
Hopefully private repositories documentation will be private

#where's the wyswyg documentation editing?
I like some of this but... I'd like more powerful UI for documenting

# may have to move again
After moving all of my repositories to GitHub and paying to keep them private their billing system refuses to update my payment card and they still haven't replied to the tickets I opened on Sunday (it's now Wednesday).

A lot of GitHub is really nice but their billing has both refused to acknowledge billing my new card while attempting to bill it 4x and their support just blows me off.

My options include:
* GitLab
* Bitbucket
* Cloudforge

And more

I seriously don't understand why they can't at least try to pretend and care about their customers billing concerns and about inappropriately keeping accounts closed after payment is made. 

#May as well downgrade to free - afaik all I lose is the wikis and I can figure something else out for that
